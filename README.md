# FLORES+ Mayas  

This is the official repository for the project "Generating Textual Resources to Foster the Development of Language Technologies for Mayan Languages".

## Overview

Recent AI advances require large datasets, which are scarce for indigenous Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala, Belize, and southern Mexico. This project aims to:

1. Digitize linguistic resources for amnumber of Mayan languages and release them as open NLP data artifacts.  
2. Create a parallel corpus, **FLORES+ Mayas**, to benchmark machine translation (MT) for Mayan languages by translating the Spanish side of FLORES+ into K'iche', Kaqchikel, Ixil, Mam, Q'anjob'al, and Q'eqchi'.

## Development  

The project runs throughout 2025 and is a collaboration between the Transducens Research Group at Universitat d'Alacant and the Proyecto Lingüístico Francisco Marroquín Foundation (FPLFM) from Guatemala. 

## Funding  

This project is gratefully funded by the Google Academic Research Awards (GARA).  

All developments will be available under open licenses at this repo.
